# CreateAnswerRequest

## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**model** | [**kotlin.String**](.md) | ID of the model to use for completion. You can select one of &#x60;ada&#x60;, &#x60;babbage&#x60;, &#x60;curie&#x60;, or &#x60;davinci&#x60;. | 
**question** | [**kotlin.String**](.md) | Question to get answered. | 
**examples** | [**kotlin.Array&lt;kotlin.Array&lt;kotlin.String&gt;&gt;**](.md) | List of (question, answer) pairs that will help steer the model towards the tone and answer format you&#x27;d like. We recommend adding 2 to 3 examples. | 
**examplesContext** | [**kotlin.String**](.md) | A text snippet containing the contextual information used to generate the answers for the &#x60;examples&#x60; you provide. | 
**documents** | [**kotlin.Array&lt;kotlin.String&gt;**](.md) | List of documents from which the answer for the input &#x60;question&#x60; should be derived. If this is an empty list, the question will be answered based on the question-answer examples.  You should specify either &#x60;documents&#x60; or a &#x60;file&#x60;, but not both.  |  [optional]
**file** | [**kotlin.String**](.md) | The ID of an uploaded file that contains documents to search over. See [upload file](/docs/api-reference/files/upload) for how to upload a file of the desired format and purpose.  You should specify either &#x60;documents&#x60; or a &#x60;file&#x60;, but not both.  |  [optional]
**searchModel** | [**kotlin.String**](.md) | ID of the model to use for [Search](/docs/api-reference/searches/create). You can select one of &#x60;ada&#x60;, &#x60;babbage&#x60;, &#x60;curie&#x60;, or &#x60;davinci&#x60;. |  [optional]
**maxRerank** | [**kotlin.Int**](.md) | The maximum number of documents to be ranked by [Search](/docs/api-reference/searches/create) when using &#x60;file&#x60;. Setting it to a higher value leads to improved accuracy but with increased latency and cost. |  [optional]
**temperature** | [**java.math.BigDecimal**](java.math.BigDecimal.md) | What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic. |  [optional]
**logprobs** | [**kotlin.Int**](.md) | Include the log probabilities on the &#x60;logprobs&#x60; most likely tokens, as well the chosen tokens. For example, if &#x60;logprobs&#x60; is 5, the API will return a list of the 5 most likely tokens. The API will always return the &#x60;logprob&#x60; of the sampled token, so there may be up to &#x60;logprobs+1&#x60; elements in the response.  The maximum value for &#x60;logprobs&#x60; is 5. If you need more than this, please contact us through our [Help center](https://help.openai.com) and describe your use case.  When &#x60;logprobs&#x60; is set, &#x60;completion&#x60; will be automatically added into &#x60;expand&#x60; to get the logprobs.  |  [optional]
**maxTokens** | [**kotlin.Int**](.md) | The maximum number of tokens allowed for the generated answer |  [optional]
**stop** | [**OneOfCreateAnswerRequestStop**](OneOfCreateAnswerRequestStop.md) | Up to 4 sequences where the API will stop generating further tokens. The returned text will not contain the stop sequence.  |  [optional]
**n** | [**kotlin.Int**](.md) | How many answers to generate for each question. |  [optional]
**logitBias** | [**kotlin.Any**](.md) | Modify the likelihood of specified tokens appearing in the completion.  Accepts a json object that maps tokens (specified by their token ID in the GPT tokenizer) to an associated bias value from -100 to 100. You can use this [tokenizer tool](/tokenizer?view&#x3D;bpe) (which works for both GPT-2 and GPT-3) to convert text to token IDs. Mathematically, the bias is added to the logits generated by the model prior to sampling. The exact effect will vary per model, but values between -1 and 1 should decrease or increase likelihood of selection; values like -100 or 100 should result in a ban or exclusive selection of the relevant token.  As an example, you can pass &#x60;{\&quot;50256\&quot;: -100}&#x60; to prevent the &lt;|endoftext|&gt; token from being generated.  |  [optional]
**returnMetadata** | [**kotlin.Boolean**](.md) | A special boolean flag for showing metadata. If set to &#x60;true&#x60;, each document entry in the returned JSON will contain a \&quot;metadata\&quot; field.  This flag only takes effect when &#x60;file&#x60; is set.  |  [optional]
**returnPrompt** | [**kotlin.Boolean**](.md) | If set to &#x60;true&#x60;, the returned JSON will include a \&quot;prompt\&quot; field containing the final prompt that was used to request a completion. This is mainly useful for debugging purposes. |  [optional]
**expand** | [**kotlin.Array&lt;kotlin.Any&gt;**](.md) | If an object name is in the list, we provide the full information of the object; otherwise, we only provide the object ID. Currently we support &#x60;completion&#x60; and &#x60;file&#x60; objects for expansion. |  [optional]
**user** | [**kotlin.String**](.md) | A unique identifier representing your end-user, which can help OpenAI to monitor and detect abuse. [Learn more](/docs/guides/safety-best-practices/end-user-ids).  |  [optional]
